# Mobile Responsive Portfolio

This Responsive Portfolio uses Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. 

My three HTML pages are as follows: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html. Within my HTML pages are links to favicon, bootstrap, and font awesome, a CSS reset, and a CSS style sheet. 

All pages have the same nav bar and the same footer. All links on the nav bar redirect you to one of my pages. On the bottom of every page in the footer are font awesome button links that redirect you to my social media pages. 

On my index.html, I have included an about me section with a header, text, and image. Included on my index.HTML is a centered carousel image. On my portfolio page, I have three bootstrap cards that display my work so far. On my contact page, I have a modified bootstrap contact form. 

For bootstrap, I have included the bootstrap grid system and built-in bootstrap class properties in the HTML. All of these pages are mobile responsive; the content shifts and resizes to accomodate the screen size. 

For semantics, I have utilized: section, footer, nav, and h1,h2,h3,etc. 

I minimized the use of media queries by using Bootstrap built in features. All of the HTML code has been put through a validation website.
